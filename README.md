# Papers

Repository to store notes and summaries for the research papers I have read, as well as a to-do list papers to read.

Papers are annotated with a Confidence Score on a (0) to (3) scale, where (0) means I have yet to read it, (1) means I have skimmed it, and (5) means I feel absolutely confident about the paper. This system was inspired by [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi)'s [paper_notes repository](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes)
